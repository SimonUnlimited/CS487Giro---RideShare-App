Screens just kind of act like layout files. E.g in the Home page file. I would usually put the body part ->
as a separate widget. 

Normally this is how I would code it: 
Home page screen: Contains -> Navar widget, Widgets that go in the body, Menu widget, Footer Widget.
This helps code be clean

-> I will update this between now and monday
